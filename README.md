# movieApp
A web app powered by Apache Tomcat 9.0 / AJAX

Hello there! Thank you for choosing movieApp for your movie exploration journey. To get
started, you'll need to replace the placeholder API key in the code with your own real API key.
Don't worry, it's a simple process! Just follow these steps:

1. Obtain Your API Key:
    Visit the OMDB API website (or the relevant API service you're using).
    Sign up or log in to create an account.
    Navigate to the API key section and generate a new API key for your project.

2. Locate the Placeholder Key:
    Open the main.js file in your project's codebase.
    Look for the line that sets the placeholder API key: const apiKey = "xxxxxx";.

3. Replace with Your API Key:
    Replace "xxxxxx" with your actual API key that you obtained from the API service. Your line of code should look like: const apiKey = "your_real_api_key_here";.

4. Save Your Changes:
    Save the main.js file after making the change.
    Ready to Go!

You're all set! Your movieApp web app is now connected to your own API key.
